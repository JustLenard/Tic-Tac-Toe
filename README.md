# Tic-Tac-Toe

Single player game of Tic Tac Toe.

The highlight of the project is the minimax ai (on which I've spent what feels like a eternity to figure out) which looks throu all the possible outcomes of the current match and chooses the most optimal way to play making IMPOSSIBLE to beat.

Very proud of myself for figuring out how all of this works.
